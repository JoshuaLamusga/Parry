This is a 2-D turn-based combat framework for role-playing games. Parry is designed with event hooks and global combat-related options to be flexible, but has defaults to compensate for complexity.

A core feature of Parry is the AI combat system that enables for team-based combat with intelligent behavior.

This is a work-in-progress, and does not yet have a stable version. As Parry comes to fruition, there will be more information listed here.
